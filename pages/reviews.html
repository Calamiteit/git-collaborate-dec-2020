<p>Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. That's my family Kay, that's not me. Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment. I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see. They talk when they should listen. What's the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he's born? My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.</p>
